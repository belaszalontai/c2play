C2PLAY for Digital Video Signage

Compared to a professional digital video signage solution here are the differences:
- in loop play the seeking time (restarting the video) is aprox. 500msec
- during the restarting process there is blank screen
- requires >= 50msec falling edge on GPIO pin to detect GPIO signal 
- terminating a video and starting a new one takes minimum 1200msec
- during video switching there is blank screen
- the playing is robust, stable and there is no memory leaking
WARNING: You can use Odroid C2 with c2play as digital video signage solution for your own responsibility!

Notes:
- the c2play must be started with root rights becase of the GPIO handling
- the normal and error outputs are redirected to /dev/null to keep black screen between videos (see SILENT variable below)
- You could prepare the Odroid C2 environment as a professional looking Video Signage device with the following not detailed steps:
	- Install Ubuntu 16.04 minimal image
	- update and upgrade
	- download and build c2play-x11 -j4 from here: https://github.com/belaszalontai/c2play/tree/xenial-signage
	- install xorg (sudo apt install xorg)
	- Other necessary todoes not detailed here:
		- redirects boot logs from the terminal screen to the serial port (silent boot)
		- solve autologin
		- sudo needs no password to grant root rights (sudo without entering password)
		- delete all unnecessar cron jobs which possibly could slowing down the Linux, except the log rotate jobs
		- disable all power saving stuff to avoid conflicts
		- disable command line prompt
- make autostart a script called start.sh
- start.sh contains only the following line: sudo startx -- -nocursor > /dev/ttyS0 2>&1
- the .xinitrc must contain the video playing scheduler script. Exmples here:

.xinitrc example #1
-------------------
### playing videos cycle one after another

### define video files
readonly VIDEO1='/home/odroid/video/a.mkv'
readonly VIDEO2='/home/odroid/video/b.mkv'
readonly VIDEO3='/home/odroid/video/c.mkv'

readonly C2PLAY=/home/odroid/c2play/c2play-x11
readonly SILENT='> /dev/null 2>&1'

### runloop
while :
do
	sudo $C2PLAY $VIDEO1 $SILENT		# plays video1
	sudo $C2PLAY $VIDEO2 $SILENT		# then plays video2
	sudo $C2PLAY $VIDEO3 $SILENT		# then plays video3
done									# restart the sequence


.xinitrc example #2
-------------------
### playing videos triggered by GPIO

### define video files
readonly VIDEO1='/home/odroid/video/a.mkv'
readonly VIDEO2='/home/odroid/video/b.mkv'
readonly VIDEO3='/home/odroid/video/c.mkv'

readonly C2PLAY=/home/odroid/c2play/c2play-x11
readonly SILENT='> /dev/null 2>&1'
readonly GPIO0=1
readonly GPIO1=2
readonly GPIO2=3
readonly GPIO3=4

### runloop
while :
do
	sudo $C2PLAY --loop $VIDEO1 $SILENT		# plays video1 in a loop until GPIO is triggered
	gpio=$?
	
	case $gpio in
		$GPIO0)
			sudo $C2PLAY $VIDEO2 $SILENT		# on GPIO0 plays video2 until end
		;;
		$GPIO1)
			sudo $C2PLAY $VIDEO3 $SILENT		# on GPIO1 plays video3 until end
		;;
	esac
done											# restart the sequence
